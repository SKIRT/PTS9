## \package pts.test.do.clean_functional Remove the output for all or a selection of the standard functional SKIRT tests
#
# This script removes the (temporary) output for all or a selection of the standard functional SKIRT test cases.
# This can be handy when manually backing up or copying the test suite hierarchy, or simply to save some disk space.
# The test case definitions are expected to reside in the \c SKIRT/Functional9 directory hierarchy.
# See the pts.test.functional module for more information.
#
# The script takes a single positional string argument, which can be one of the following:
#  - "." (a single period): clean all test cases in the standard suite.
#  - "testcase" (the name of a test case directory): clean all test cases with that name.
#  - "subsuite" (the name of an intermediate directory in the hierarchy): clean the test cases in all sub-suites
#    with that name.
#  - "parentsubsuite/testcase" or "parentsubsuite/subsuite": clean the indicated test case(s) or sub-suite(s)
#    that reside immediately inside the indicated parent sub-suite; this can disambiguate items with the same name.
