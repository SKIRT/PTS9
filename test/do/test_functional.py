## \package pts.test.do.test_functional Perform all or a selection of the standard functional SKIRT tests
#
# This script performs all or a selection of the standard functional SKIRT test cases.
# The test case definitions are expected to reside in the \c SKIRT/Functional9 directory hierarchy.
# See the pts.test.functional module for more information.
#
# The script takes a single positional string argument, which can be one of the following:
#  - "." (a single period): perform all test cases in the standard suite.
#  - "testcase" (the name of a test case directory): perform all test cases with that name.
#  - "subsuite" (the name of an intermediate directory in the hierarchy): perform the test cases in all sub-suites
#    with that name.
#  - "parentsubsuite/testcase" or "parentsubsuite/subsuite": perform the indicated test case(s) or sub-suite(s)
#    that reside immediately inside the indicated parent sub-suite; this can disambiguate items with the same name.
#
# In addition, the script accepts two optional arguments:
#  - \em skirt: the path to the skirt executable. If specified, the path is interpreted as described for
#    the pts.utils.absPath() function. If omitted, the default path is used as described for the constructor
#    of the pts.simulation.skirt.Skirt class.
#  - \em visual: a string describing the visualizations to be created for the output of each test case, if any.
#    If specified, the string is a semicolon-separated list of PTS visualization commands as they would be entered
#    at the command line, omitting the simulation output path argument (which will be inserted automatically).
