## \package pts.band.broadband Class for representing broadband filters
#
# This module contains the BroadBand class. An instance of this class represents
# a broadband filter with a given transmission curve.

# -----------------------------------------------------------------

## An instance of the BroadBand class represents a broadband filter with a given transmission curve.
# Broadcast instances are usually obtained by loading built-in band definitions using one of the class functions
# builtinBands() or builtinBand() as opposed to directly invoking the constructor. However, for specific use cases,
# a Broadcast instance can also be constructed directly, for example to obtain a uniform filter with constant
# transmission over a specified wavelength range. For more information, refer to the documentation of the constructor.
#
# Built-in bands
# --------------
#
# This class relies on SKIRT resource files to provide built-in broadband definitions. These resource files are
# written in the SKIRT stored table format and have names that end with "_BroadBand.stab". The first part of
# the file name identifies the particular band being represented.
#
# The class recursively searches for broadband resource files in the contents of two directories, if they exist:
# the ~/SKIRT/resources directory and the ~/PTS/resources directory. In other words, if SKIRT has been installed
# and all relevant resource packs have been installed, all broadbands available to SKIRT are available to this class
# as well. In case SKIRT is not installed on the same system (and in the same project directory), one can manually
# download the appropriate resource packs from the SKIRT web site, unzip the archives, and place the files in the
# ~/PTS/resources directory.
#
# For a list of available broadbands, see the documentation of the SKIRT %BroadBand class, or use the
# "pts list_bands" command.
#
# Band properties and operations
# ------------------------------
#
# This class offers operations such as determining the band's pivot wavelength and convolving an SED
# or a frame data cube with the band's transmission curve.
#
# Refer to the appendix in Camps et al. 2016 (MNRAS 462, 1057-1075) for a brief introduction of
# the relevant concepts and a derivation of the corresponding formulas. For the purposes of this
# class, a band is defined through its arbitrarily scaled transmission curve \f$T(\lambda)\f$.
# The relative transmission at a given wavelength can then be written as \f[
# T_\text{rel}(\lambda) = \frac{ T(\lambda) } { \max[ T(\lambda) ] }. \f]
#
# Given a spectral energy distribution \f$L_\lambda(\lambda)\f$, the mean specific luminosity
# over the band \f$\left<L_\lambda\right>\f$ can then be obtained through \f[
# \left<L_\lambda\right> = \frac{ \int L_\lambda(\lambda)T(\lambda) \,\mathrm{d}\lambda } { \int
# T(\lambda) \,\mathrm{d}\lambda }. \f]
#
# The pivot wavelength of the band is defined as the wavelength at which the mean specific
# luminosity can be properly converted between wavelength and frequency representations. It is
# given by \f[ \lambda_\mathrm{pivot} = \sqrt{ \frac{ \int T(\lambda) \,\mathrm{d}\lambda } {
# \int T(\lambda) \,\mathrm{d}\lambda/\lambda^2 } }. \f]
#
# The effective width of the band is defined as the horizontal size of a rectangle with height
# equal to the maximum transmission and with the same area as the one covered by the band's
# transmission curve. It is given by \f[ W_\mathrm{eff} = \frac{ \int T(\lambda)
# \,\mathrm{d}\lambda } { \max[ T(\lambda) ] }. \f]
#
# As set forth by Camps et al. 2016, for energy measuring devices (bolometers) the total system
# transmission \f$T(\lambda)\f$ is usually given by the instrument designers, and it can be used
# directly for this class. For photon counters (including all instruments in the UV, optical and
# near infrared), the total system response \f$R(\lambda)\f$ is usually given instead. The
# transmission curve needed for this class can be derived from the response curve through \f[
# T(\lambda) = \lambda\,R(\lambda). \f]
#
# Also, to further simplify the above formulas, the constructor normalizes the transmission curve
# to unity, i.e. \f[ \int T(\lambda) \,\mathrm{d}\lambda = 1. \f]
#
class BroadBand:
    ## The file paths for all detected built-in band definitions (i.e. ending with "_BroadBand.stab")
    _bandpaths = set()

    ## Flag becomes True as soon as bandpaths have been added for the SKIRT and PTS resource directories
    _added = False

    ## As mentioned in the class header, built-in Broadcast instances can be obtained using one of the class functions
    # builtinBands() or builtinBand() as opposed to directly invoking the constructor. For more information, refer to
    # the doumentation of these functions.
    #
    # The constructor supports the following use cases, depending on the type of the \em bandspec argument:
    #
    #   - If \em bandspec is a string or a pathlib.Path, it should refer to a file in SKIRT stored table format
    #     that contains a properly normalized band definition (i.e., the same format as built-in band definitions).
    #     The BroadBand instance is constructed by loading the contents of this file.
    #
    #   - if \em bandspec is a tuple with two numbers, a bolometer-type band is constructed with a uniform
    #     transmission curve in the indicated (min,max) wavelength range expressed in micron.
    #
    #   - if \em bandspec is a two-dimensional numpy array, a custom bolometer-type band is constructed using
    #     \em bandspec[:,0] as wavelength grid and \em bandspec[:,1] as transmission curve. The wavelengths
    #     must be expressed in micron, while the transmission curve has arbitrary scaling.
    #     The array layout used here is identical to what one would obtain when applying numpy.loadtxt()
    #     to the input file for a SKIRT FileBand.
    #
    # If \em bandspec has a different type, or if the string/path does not refer to a file in the proper format,
    # the constructor raises an exception.
    #
    # \note As indicated above, the constructor expects the wavelengths specifying uniform and custom bands
    # as plain numbers expressed in micron. In contrast, the wavelengths and transmissions stored and returned
    # by this class are astropy quantities that include poper units. For uniform and custom bands, these units
    # will be micron (wavelengths) and 1/micron (transmissions). For built-in bands, these units will be
    # m (wavelengths) and 1/m (transmissions). Clients of this class should thus properly honor the astropy
    # units of any values returned by this class.

    # and/or units.

    # The function accepts the following arguments:
    # - \em wavelengths: an astropy quantity array specifying the wavelengths \f$\lambda_\ell\f$, in increasing order,
    #   on which the fluxes are sampled. The convolution is performed on a wavelength grid that combines the grid
    #   points given here with the grid points on which the band transmission curve is defined.
    # - \em fluxes: an astropy quantity array specifying the flux distribution(s) \f$F_\lambda(\lambda_\ell)\f$.
    #   This can be an array with the same length as \em wavelengths, or a multi-dimensional
    #   array where the last dimension has the same length as \em wavelengths.
    #   The returned result will have the shape of \em fluxes minus the last (or only) dimension.
    # - \em numWavelengths: an integer specifying the approximate number of wavelength grid points used in the
    #   convolution calculation, or None (or omitted) to indicate no limit. The incoming flux distribution is resampled
    #   to all wavelength points in the combined convolution grid. Convolving large data cubes may thus consume
    #   a prohibitive amount of memory and/or computation time unless the number of wavelengths is limited.
    # - \em flavor: the flavor and/or units to which the result must be converted. If missing or None, the result
    #   is converted back to the flavor and units of the incoming fluxes. If specified, this can be one of the
    #   strings "neutral", "wavelength", or "frequency", or an explicit astropy unit instance that is compatible
