## \package pts.storedtable.convert_band Functions for writing filter transmission curves to stored table format
#
# The functions in this module can load PTS built-in or user-provided broadband filters
# and output their transmission curves to SKIRT stored table format.

## This function outputs the transmission curves for all PTS built-in broadbands to stored table files.
# The function ignores the input file paths and it expects a single output file path. The latter is interpreted
# as a template where the asterisk will be replaced by the appropriate PTS band name.
def writeBroadBands(inFilePaths, outFilePaths):

    # loop over all builtin bands
    for name in bnd.builtinBandNames():
        band = bnd.BroadBand(name)

        # construct the output file path based on the band ID
        outFilePath = outFilePaths[0].replace("*",name)

        # get the transmission curve
        w, T = band.transmissionCurve()

        # write stored table

## This function converts a set of filter response curves given in SVO XML format to stored table files.
# The function expects a single input file path template with wildcards expanding to the set of input file names,
# and a single output file path template in which the asterisk will be replaced by the appropriate band name.
# This band name is derived from the input file name by removing the filename extension, converting to uppercase,
# and replacing any dots by underscores.
