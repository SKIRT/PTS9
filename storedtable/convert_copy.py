## \package pts.storedtable.convert_copy Function to "convert" stored table files by simply copying them

# The function in this module has the same signature as the functions for converting some type of data
# into SKIRT stored table format, however, it expects its input files to already have the correct format.

## This function expects a sequence of input file paths and corresponding output file paths.
# It simply copies each of the input files to corresponding output file path.
# In other words, the function has the same signature as the functions for converting some type of data
# into SKIRT stored table format, however, it expects its input files to already have the correct format.
