## \package pts.skiupgrade.do.upgrade_ski_files Upgrade ski files in a given directory to the latest version of SKIRT
#
# This script upgrades all SKIRT 9 ski files in a given directory to be appropriate for the latest version of SKIRT 9.
# Specifically, the script iterates over all files in the directory with the .ski filename extension and performs
# as follows for each:
# - if the file is not a SKIRT parameter file, or it is intended for a SKIRT version before version 9, an error
#   message is logged and the file is otherwise ignored.
# - if the file is a SKIRT 9 parameter file and it is up to date with the latest version of SKIRT 9, an informational
#   message is logged and the file is otherwise ignored.
# - if the file is a SKIRT 9 parameter file that needs upgrading, it is first copied to a backup version with a
#   filename including a time stamp, it is then replaced by a version upgraded to the latest version of SKIRT 9,
#   and a warning message is logged.
#
# The script takes a single positional string argument specifying the path to the directory containing the ski files to
# be upgraded, or "." (a single period) for the current directory.
#
# See the pts.skiupgrade.skiupgrade module for more information on the ski file upgrade process.
