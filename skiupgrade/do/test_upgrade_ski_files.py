## \package pts.skiupgrade.do.test_upgrade_ski_files Test upgrading ski files to the latest version of SKIRT
#
# This script upgrades all SKIRT 9 ski files in a given directory to be appropriate for the latest version of SKIRT 9
# without touching the original files. Instead the upgraded versions are given a new name. This is useful when testing
# the upgrade procedure for a newly updated SKIRT version.
#
# Specifically, the script iterates over all files in the directory with the .ski filename extension and performs
# as follows for each:
# - if the file is not a SKIRT parameter file, or it is intended for a SKIRT version before version 9, an error
#   message is logged and the file is otherwise ignored.
# - if the file is a SKIRT 9 parameter file and it is up to date with the latest version of SKIRT 9, an informational
#   message is logged and the file is otherwise ignored.
# - if the file is a SKIRT 9 parameter file that needs upgrading, the version upgraded to the latest version of SKIRT 9
#   is placed in a file with a name similar to the original including the string "upgraded", and a warning message
#   is logged.
#
# The script takes a single positional string argument specifying the path to the directory containing the ski files to
# be upgraded, or "." (a single period) for the current directory.
#
# See the pts.skiupgrade.skiupgrade module for more information on the ski file upgrade process.
