## \package pts.skiupgrade.skiupgrade Contains the upgradeSkiFile function for upgrading SKIRT parameter files
#
# The upgradeSkiFile function in this module allows upgrading SKIRT parameter files (\em ski files)
# between versions of SKIRT 9.

# -----------------------------------------------------------------

import logging
import pts.simulation as sm
import pts.utils as ut

# -----------------------------------------------------------------

## This function upgrades the specified SKIRT 9 parameter file (\em ski file) so that it becomes appropriate for the
# latest SKIRT 9 version. The upgrade process supports all ski files created by the SKIRT project version 9 tools
# (including the SKIRT command line Q&A and the graphical MakeUp wizard) since SKIRT 9 was publicly released.
# Ski files created for older SKIRT versions (such as SKIRT 7 and 8) cannot be upgraded to SKIRT 9 automatically.
#
# The function accepts three arguments:
# - inpath: the absolute or relative path to the ski file to be handled; the filename extension should be ".ski"
# - backup: if the input ski file needs upgrading and \em backup is True (the default), a copy of the input ski file
#           is created with a filename including a time stamp and ending with "_backupski.xml"
# - replace: if the input ski file needs upgrading and \em replace is True (the default), the input ski file is
#            overwritten by the upgraded version; otherwise it is saved as a new file using a similar filename ending
#            with "_upgradedski.xml"
#
