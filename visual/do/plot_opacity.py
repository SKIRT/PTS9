## \package pts.visual.do.plot_opacity Plot planar opacity cuts or projections from one or more SKIRT simulations
#
# This script creates plots of the opacity cuts or projections produced by the OpacityProbe in a SKIRT simulation.
# The script supports OpacityProbe instances with an associated probe form that produces a planar cut (DefaultCutsForm,
# PlanarCutsForm) or planar projection (ParallelProjectionForm, AllSkyProjectionForm). For cuts, the plotted quantity
# is an opacity \f$k=\kappa\rho=n\varsigma\f$; for projections, the plotted quantity is an optical depth \f$\tau\f$.
# If the simulation does not include any supported probes, the script does nothing.
#
# \note If the wavelength grid configured for the opacity probe specifies more than a single wavelength, the probe's
# output is a data cube with a frame for each of these wavelengths. In that case, this script selects the middle frame
# from the data cube, i.e. the frame with index int("nr of frames" / 2).
# This is a work-around to make plot_opacity work now that the opacity probe can output multiple frames.
#
# If the output for a given medium component or medium type (dust, gas, or electrons) includes two or three files
# with names that differ only by orientation labels ("_xy", "_xz", and/or "_yz"), the density maps for these
# files are included in a single plot and share the same scale.
#
# The script takes the following arguments:
#  - \em simDirPath (positional string argument): the path to the SKIRT simulation output directory,
#                                                 or "." for the current directory
#  - \em prefix (string): the prefix of the simulation to handle; by default handles all simulations in the directory
#  - \em dex (float): if specified, the number of decades to be included in the opacity range (color bar); default is 5
#
# In all cases, the plot file is placed next to the simulation output file(s) being handled. The filename includes the
# simulation prefix, the probe name, and the medium component or type indicator, and has the ".pdf" filename extension.
