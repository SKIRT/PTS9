## \package pts.visual.do.plot_sources Plot the luminosity of and packets launched by one or more SKIRT simulations
#
# This script creates plots of the behavior of the sources in a SKIRT simulations. Specifically, it plots
# the luminosity of and the number of photon packets launched by each source as a function of wavelength.
# Both curves are normalized so that their maximum value is equal to one. This allows a user to evaluate
# whether the photon packet distribution (as a function of wavelength) is appropriate for the source spectra.
#
# The script requires that the simulation includes exactly one LuminosityProbe and exactly one LaunchedPacketsProbe.
# If this is not the case, the function does nothing.
#
# The script takes the following arguments:
#  - \em simDirPath (positional string argument): the path to the SKIRT simulation output directory,
#                                                 or "." for the current directory
#  - \em prefix (string): the prefix of the simulation to handle; by default handles all simulations in the directory
#  - \em wmin (float): smallest wavelength on the horizontal axis; default is 0.1
#  - \em wmax (float): largest wavelength on the horizontal axis; default is 1000
#  - \em unit (string): unit of the wavelength limits (any spectral unit); default is micron
#  - \em dex (float): if specified, the number of decades to be plotted on the vertical axis; default is 5
#
# In all cases, the plot file is placed next to the simulation output file(s) being handled. The filename starts
# with the simulation prefix and ends with "sources.pdf".
