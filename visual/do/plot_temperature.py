## \package pts.visual.do.plot_temperature Plot planar temperature cuts or projections from one or more SKIRT simulations
#
# This script creates plots of the temperature cuts or projections produced by one of the relevant probes
# in a SKIRT simulation. The script supports TemperatureProbe and/or ImportedMediumTemperatureProbe
# instances with an associated probe form that produces a planar cut (DefaultCutsForm, PlanarCutsForm) or planar
# projection (ParallelProjectionForm, AllSkyProjectionForm). If the simulation does not include any supported probes,
# the script does nothing.
#
# If the output for a given medium component or medium type (dust, gas, or electrons) includes two or three files
# with names that differ only by orientation labels ("_xy", "_xz", and/or "_yz"), the temperature maps for these
# files are included in a single plot and share the same temperature scale.
#
# The script takes the following arguments:
#  - \em simDirPath (positional string argument): the path to the SKIRT simulation output directory,
#                                                 or "." for the current directory
#  - \em prefix (string): the prefix of the simulation to handle; by default handles all simulations in the directory
#  - \em dex (float): if specified, the number of decades in the temperature range on a logarithmic scale;
#                     the default value is 0 to indicate a linear temperature scale.
#
# In all cases, the plot file is placed next to the simulation output file(s) being handled. The filename includes the
# simulation prefix, the probe name, and the medium component or type indicator, and has the ".pdf" filename extension.
