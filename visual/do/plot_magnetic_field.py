## \package pts.visual.do.plot_magnetic_field Plot planar magnetic field cuts or projections from a SKIRT simulation
#
# This script creates PDF vector maps for the planar magnetic field cuts or projections produced by one of the relevant
# probes in a SKIRT simulation, allowing a visual evaluation of the magnetic field's spatial distribution.
#
# The script supports MagneticFieldProbe instances with an associated probe form that produces a planar cut
# (DefaultCutsForm, PlanarCutsForm) or planar projection (ParallelProjectionForm, AllSkyProjectionForm).
# If the simulation does not include any supported probes, the script does nothing.
#
# The script takes the following arguments:
#  - \em simDirPath (positional string argument): the path to the SKIRT simulation output directory,
#                                                 or "." for the current directory
#  - \em prefix (string): the prefix of the simulation to handle; by default handles all simulations in the directory
#  - \em bin: the number of pixels in each bin in both horizontal and vertical directions.
#
# In all cases, the plot file is placed next to the simulation output file(s) being handled. The plot file has the same
# name as the SKIRT output file from which it is derived but with the ".pdf" filename extension instead of ".fits".
