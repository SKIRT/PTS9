## \package pts.visual.do.plot_spectral_resolution Plot the spectral resolution of a wavelength axis
#
# This script creates a plot of the spectral resolution \f$R=\lambda/\Delta\lambda\f$ of a wavelength grid
# loaded from a SKIRT stored table (".stab") or a SKIRT output file (".dat") that includes a wavelength axis.
#
# Provide the name or (relative or absolute) file path of a SKIRT stored table file or a SKIRT output file
# as the single required argument, and use optional arguments to further configure the plot:
#  - \em wmin (float): smallest wavelength on the horizontal axis, in micron; default is 0.1 micron
#  - \em wmax (float): largest wavelength on the horizontal axis, in micron; default is 1000 micron
#  - \em dex (float): if specified, the number of decades to be plotted on the vertical axis; default is 3
#  - \em title (string): the title used in the plot legend; default is the name of the input file
#
# The plot file has the same name as the input file but with the ".pdf" filename extension and is placed
# in the current working directory.
