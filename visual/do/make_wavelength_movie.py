## \package pts.visual.do.make_wavelength_movie Create a movie that runs through all wavelengths in the SKIRT simulation output
#
# This script creates a movie in MP4 format for the output of the specified simulation. The movie combines the SEDs
# (bottom panel) and the pixel frames (top panel, from left to right) for up to three instruments, running through all
# wavelengths in the simulation.
#
# The script takes the following arguments:
#  - \em simDirPath (positional string argument): the path to the SKIRT simulation output directory,
#                                                 or "." for the current directory.
#  - \em prefix (string): the prefix of the simulation to handle; by default handles all simulations in the directory.
#  - \em instruments (string): up to three comma-separated instrument names; by default handles the first three
#                              instruments in the simulated configuration.
#  - \em percentile (float): the percentile value in range [0,100] used to determine the maximum surface brightness in
#                   the images. The default value is 100, so that the largest surface brightness value in the frame(s)
#                   determines the maximum value. A smaller percentile value such as 99 could be used to exclude the
#                   very largest surface brightness values (for example, the direct light from a point source).
#  - \em dex (float): the number of decades in the surface brightness range in the images. The default value is 5.
#  - \em renormalize (int): a flag selecting one of two image scaling options. When zero (the default value), the
#                   surface brightness range is determined for the complete data cube and kept constant for all frames.
#                   As a result, image frames might be completely dark at wavelengths with very low overall luminosity.
#                   When nonzero, the surface brightness range is determined for each frame separately. This allows to
#                   see the spatial structure of the surface brightness even at wavelengths with very low luminosity.
#  - \em rate:      the frame rate of the movie, in frames per second. The default value is 7.
#
# By default, the movie is saved in the output directory of the first instrument, using a name starting with the
# corresponding simulation prefix and ending with ".mp4". This can be overridden with the out* arguments as described
# for the pts.utils.savePath() function.
