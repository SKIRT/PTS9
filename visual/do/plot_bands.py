## \package pts.visual.do.plot_bands Plot built-in broadband transmission curves
#
# This script creates a plot of the transmission curves for all built-in broadbands that satisfy
# all of the specified selection criteria:
#  - \em names (string with comma-separated segments): if specified, the band name must contain
#    at least one of these segments
#  - \em wmin (float): if specified, the pivot wavelength must exceed this value
#  - \em wmax (float): if specified, the pivot wavelength must be lower than this value
#
# The plot file is named "FigBuiltinBands.pdf" and is placed in the current working directory.
