# -----------------------------------------------------------------

## This function creates a movie for the output of the specified simulation. The movie combines the SEDs (bottom panel)
# and the pixel frames (top panel, from left to right) for up to three instruments, running through all wavelengths
# in the simulation.
#
# The function takes the following arguments:
#  - simulation:    a sequence of Simulation and/or Instrument instances (or a single instance of one of these types).
#                   The sequence is expanded into a list of up to three instruments; any extra instruments are ignored.
#                   All instruments in the final list must include an integrated SED ("*_sed.dat" file) as well as
#                   total flux pixel frames ("*_total.fits" file). All instruments must use the same wavelength grid,
#                   and the instruments frames must have the same pixel size. These requirements are not verified.
#                   The fluxes and surface brightness values are plotted in the units of the SKIRT output.
#  - maxPercentile: the percentile value in range [0,100] used to determine the maximum surface brightness in the
#                   images. The default value is 100, so that the largest surface brightness value in the frame(s)
#                   determines the maximum value. A smaller percentile value such as 99 could be used to exclude the
#                   very largest surface brightness values (for example, the direct light from a point source).
#  - minPercentile: the percentile value in range [0,100] used to determine the minimum surface brightness in the
#                   images. The default value is 10. This argument is ignored if \em decades is specified.
#  - decades:       the number of decades in the surface brightness range in the images. This is an alternative way
#                   to determine the minimum value once the maximum has been obtained using  \em maxPercentile.
#                   By default, the \em minPercentile mechanism is used instead.
#  - renormalize:   a Boolean flag selecting one of two image scaling options. When False (the default value), the
#                   surface brightness range is determine for the complete data cube and kept constant for all frames.
#                   As a result, image frames might be completely dark at wavelengths with very low overall luminosity.
#                   When True, the surface brightness range is determined for each frame separately. This allows to see
#                   the spatial structure of the surface brightness even at wavelengths with very low luminosity.
#  - outDirPath:    when specified, overrides the default output directory path.
#  - outFileName:   when specified, overrides the filename portion of the default output path.
#  - outFilePath:   when specified, overrides the the complete output file path.
#  - rate:          the frame rate of the movie, in frames per second. The default value is 7.
#
# By default, the movie is saved in the output directory of the first instrument, using a name starting with the
# corresponding simulation prefix and ending with ".mp4". This can be overridden with the out* arguments as described
# for the pts.utils.savePath() function.
